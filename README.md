# üêï Fetch Reward Points Api
API that that accepts HTTP requests and returns responses to read, add, and spend user points through payer/partner transactions. 

## Background
- Users have points in their accounts
- Users only see a single balance in their accounts
- For reporting purposes points are tracked by payer/partner
- Transaction records contain:

| transaction_id| Payer         | Points  | Timestamp |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------:| ---------:|
| integer       | string.       | integer | date      |

- ```Transactions```: stored by payer and date
- ```Add Points```: new transaction that records payer and point amount
- ```Spend Points```: new transaction that records point amount and follows below conditions
    + oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order they‚Äôre received)
    + payer's points cannot be negative.

## Technologies
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Knex](http://knexjs.org/)
- [PostgreSql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## Setup

### Quick Setup
- the program is deployed with Heroku at [https://fetch-reward-points.herokuapp.com/](https://fetch-reward-points.herokuapp.com/)
   + to make API calls/test endpoints to the deployed program, skip ahead to the **API Calls** section


### Run Locally

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kfam22/reward-points-api.git
```

2. Go to the root directory and install dependencies
```
npm i
```

3. Start the server
```
npm run start
```
 - the following should be logged in the terminal
 ```
 lisetning on 9000
 ```
4. Confirm server is up by visiting ```http://localhost:9000/``` in the browser
- you should see the following message
```
{
  "message": "Here to fetch reward points? Please navigate to a valid endpoint."
}
```
5. Run Tests
```
npm run test
```
- There are two test files
    + ```transactionsModel.test.js``` tests the database access functions
    + ```server.test.js``` tests the endpoints

## API Calls
The database is initialized with the following seed data:

| transaction_id| Payer         | Points  | Timestamp |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------:| ---------:|
| 1             | TARGET        | 100     | date      |
| 2             | WALMART       | 1000    | date      |
| 3             | AMAZON        | 400     | date      |
| 4             | TRADER JOES   | 100     | date      |
| 5             | TARGET        | 100     | date      |
| 6             | WALMART       | 200     | date      |
